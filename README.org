#+title: Building OpenCV 4.2.0 On Arch Arm for the Raspberry Pi 4 

By the way I use Arch Arm Linux on my Raspberry Pi's.

It is:
- Tight
- Arch
- Not Raspian
- Performant
- In line with all my other machine in the lab and house

* Installing Arch on the Pi4

Be sure to use the correct image from [[https://archlinuxarm.org][Arch Linux Arm]], specifically [[https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-4][Raspberry Pi 4]]

** Install Arch on the Pi 4

   The Raspberry Pi 4 has higher power requirements than the Raspberry
   Pi 3. A power supply rated at 3A is the official recommendation. Using an
   insufficient power supply will result in random, inexplicable errors and
   file system corruption.

   Early variants of the Raspberry Pi 4's USB Type-C power port is not compliant
   with the USB Type-C specification, and it will not be able to be powered by
   supplies that are compliant.

*** Prep SD card and install Arch
    Replace sdX in the following instructions with the device name for the SD
    card as it appears on your computer.

    Use ~lsblk~ to verify which labels belong to the target SD card:
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    ❯ lsblk
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    loop0    7:0    0 156.7M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/gnome-3-28-1804/110
    loop1    7:1    0  44.9M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/gtk-common-themes/1440
    loop2    7:2    0  54.7M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/core18/1650
    loop3    7:3    0  97.4M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/signal-desktop/277
    loop4    7:4    0  22.4M  1 loop /var/lib/snapd/snap/snapd/5754
    sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
    ├─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /efi
    ├─sda2   8:2    0    32G  0 part [SWAP]
    └─sda3   8:3    0   899G  0 part /
    sdb      8:16   0   2.7T  0 disk 
    └─sdb1   8:17   0   2.7T  0 part 
    sdc      8:32   1  29.7G  0 disk 
    ├─sdc1   8:33   1   100M  0 part /run/media/thys/7CE9-4243
    └─sdc2   8:34   1  29.6G  0 part /run/media/thys/f814e33d-4b31-4bf4-8dd8-dbff7fe0f570
    #+END_SRC

    In this case the SD card is ~sdc~

    1. Use fdisk to partition the SD card:
       ~fdisk /dev/sdX~
    2. At the fdisk prompt, delete old partitions and create a new one:
       - Type o. This will clear out any partitions on the drive.
       - Type p to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
       - Type n, then p for primary, 1 for the first partition on the drive,
       - press ENTER to accept the default first sector, then type +100M for the
       - last sector.
       - Type t, then c to set the first partition to type W95 FAT32 (LBA).
       - Type n, then p for primary, 2 for the second partition on the drive,
       - and then press ENTER twice to accept the default first and last sector.
       - Write the partition table and exit by typing w.
    3. Create and mount the FAT file system:
       #+BEGIN_SRC 
       mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1
       mkdir boot
       mount /dev/sdX1 boot
       #+END_SRC
    4. Create and mount the ext4 file system:
       #+BEGIN_SRC 
       mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2
       mkdir root
       mount /dev/sdX2 root
       #+END_SRC
    5. Download and extract the root file system (as root, not via sudo):
       #+BEGIN_SRC 
       wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz
       bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz -C root
       sync
       #+END_SRC 
    6. Move boot files to the first partition:
       ~mv root/boot/* boot~
    7. Unmount the two partitions:
       ~umount boot root~
    8. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect ethernet, and apply 5V power.
    9. Use the serial console or SSH to the IP address given to the board by your router.
       - Login as the default user alarm with the password alarm.
       - The default root password is root.
    10. Initialize the pacman keyring and populate the Arch Linux ARM package signing keys:
        #+BEGIN_SRC 
        pacman-key --init
        pacman-key --populate archlinuxarm
        #+END_SRC
